# SGM
Segmented Genome Model (SGM) Builder
The application for generating models from the genomes which are segmented and clustered genomes. This process involves a two step in the analysis; the first step accepts the genomes and performes the segmentation and clustering of each genome to provide multiple cluster files of each genomes. The second steps accepts the metagenome read file (in FASTA format), the program makes the markov chain indices fro rabpid calculation of read probabilities against the clusters of each genome file instead of complete genome files.
